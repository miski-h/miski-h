## Open Source Reflections

### 1. Integreat CMS, Adding Location Info to Events (PR #3967)
I contributed a feature to the [Integreat CMS](https://github.com/digitalfabrik/integreat-cms) project that appends the LOCATION field from iCal imports to event descriptions.  
This change ensures users can easily see where and how to participate in imported events.  

**What I learned:**
- How to navigate a large Django-based codebase.
- Debugging Docker/Devcontainer setup and database containers.
- Using Ruff, release notes, and CI checks.
- Collaborating with maintainers in a professional open-source workflow.
